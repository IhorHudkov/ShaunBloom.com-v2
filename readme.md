# ShaunBloom.com-v2-webpack-babel-es6-less
I built the original version of this site in 2012 using only the JQuery framework and vanillia JS . This new version recreates the orignal JQuery site but using the latest tools as in Webpack/Babel/ES6 and no frontend frameworks to assist in the animations. Should act and function just as the original did. Good challenge and great opportunity to get caught up on all the latest tools and JavaScript advancements.
